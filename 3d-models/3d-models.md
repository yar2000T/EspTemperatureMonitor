# Using .stl Files with PrusaSlicer

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to use .stl files with PrusaSlicer for 3D printing.

## Requirements
- PrusaSlicer software installed on your computer.
- A 3D printer (e.g., Prusa i3 MK3S).

## Steps to Use .stl Files

### 1. Open PrusaSlicer
- Launch PrusaSlicer from your desktop or applications menu.

### 2. Import .stl File
- Click on the **Add** button in the top left corner of the PrusaSlicer window.
- Navigate to the folder containing your .stl file and select it.
- The .stl file will appear in the **Object List**.

### 3. Configure Print Settings
- Select the .stl file in the **Object List**.
- Adjust the print settings using the right panel. This includes:
  - **Printer Profile**: Choose the 3D printer model.
  - **Filament**: Select the appropriate material and color.
  - **Layer Height**: Set the desired layer height for print quality.
  - **Print Speed**: Adjust the speed to match your printer capabilities.
  - **Infill Density**: Choose how dense the interior of the print should be.

### 4. Preview the Print
- Click the **Slice Now** button to preview the slicing process.
- Review the 3D model and ensure it is oriented correctly and fits within the build volume of your printer.

### 5. Save the G-code
- Click on **Save to File** to generate the G-code for your 3D printer.
- Choose a location on your computer to save the file and give it a meaningful name.

### 6. Print
- Transfer the generated G-code to your 3D printer using an SD card, USB connection, or another method.
- Load the file on your printer and start the print job.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with slicing (e.g., errors, failed prints), check the **Message Log** in PrusaSlicer for any warnings or errors.
- Ensure that your printer settings match the capabilities of the filament you are using.
- Verify that the .stl file is not corrupted and is correctly oriented.
